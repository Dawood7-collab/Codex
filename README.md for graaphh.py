Python Plotting Practice
This repository contains Python code for practicing data visualization and plotting with Matplotlib .

About the Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a collection of Python scripts for practicing plotting and data visualization techniques. The scripts cover a range of examples, from basic line plots to more advanced visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

Getting Started
To use this code, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. You can install these libraries using pip, a Python package manager:

Copy code
pip install matplotlib 
Once you have the libraries installed, you can run the Python scripts in any Python IDE or from the command line.
